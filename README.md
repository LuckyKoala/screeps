# Screeps

This is my taks-based Screeps AI. It is very powerful and its possible to reach at least TOP 30 of all players with it. Nevertheless, the implementation is very complex and not every feature is finished.

The main feature of the implementation are the tast-based approach. Every creep action is generated by tasks, so that creeps only process the given action instead of choosing by their own. This allows global optimization. Furthermore the spawn implementation is also task-based.

The code documentation is very rare, but you will figure it out.

Use deployLocalMac.sh if you are on Mac.
